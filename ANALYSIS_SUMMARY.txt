REPOSITORY ANALYSIS COMPLETE
============================

Date: January 8, 2026
Repository: evankellener/MMA-AI
Analyzed by: GitHub Copilot

WHAT IS THIS REPOSITORY?
========================
A UFC fight prediction system achieving 71% accuracy through advanced feature 
engineering and machine learning. Transforms 22 base statistics into 20,000+ 
features using opponent-adjusted performance metrics, time-decay weighting, 
and Bayesian shrinkage.

KEY METRICS
===========
- Accuracy: 71% (beats Vegas)
- Log Loss: 0.603
- Brier Score: 0.207
- Betting ROI: 10-35% (strategy dependent)
- Database: 39,964 fight records from 757 UFC events

DELIVERABLES
============
✅ REPOSITORY_ANALYSIS.md - Comprehensive 510-line technical analysis
✅ QUICK_REFERENCE.md - 134-line quick-start guide
✅ requirements.txt - Complete Python dependencies

ANALYSIS STRUCTURE
==================

REPOSITORY_ANALYSIS.md covers:
- Repository structure & architecture
- 6-step feature engineering pipeline
- AdjPerf methodology (core innovation)
- Model performance & betting strategies
- Code quality assessment
- 15 actionable recommendations
- Security considerations

QUICK_REFERENCE.md provides:

CORE INNOVATION: ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE (AdjPerf)
================================================
adjperf = clip((observed - μ_shrunk) / MAD_shrunk, -7, +7)

Normalizes fighter performance by:
- Opponent difficulty (historical "allowed" baseline)
- Weight class priors (division averages)
- Time decay (1.5-year half-life)
- Bayesian shrinkage (handles small samples)

Example: Landing 10 strikes vs elite defender (adjperf +3.5) > 
         Landing 20 strikes vs weak defender (adjperf +1.0)

PIPELINE STATUS
===============
Step 1: Fight → Fighter Aggregation    ✅ COMPLETE (1,547 lines)
Step 2: Time-Decayed Averages          ✅ COMPLETE (717 lines)
Step 3: Opponent-Adjusted Performance  ✅ COMPLETE (integrated)
Step 4: Comparative Features           ✅ COMPLETE (diffs/ratios)
Step 5: Feature Selection              ✅ COMPLETE (~30 features)
Step 6: Model Training                 ✅ COMPLETE (AutoGluon)

TOP RECOMMENDATIONS
===================
1. Add unit tests for statistical functions
2. Pin dependency versions for reproducibility
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add logging framework
5. Consider parquet format for large datasets

TECHNOLOGY STACK
================
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy (data processing)
- scikit-learn (feature selection)
- SQLite (data storage)
- AutoGluon (model training)
- pytesseract, Pillow (OCR)

CONCLUSION
==========
Production-ready research code with strong statistical foundations. The complete
6-step pipeline successfully transforms raw UFC data into highly predictive 
features, achieving better accuracy than Vegas odds. Would benefit from standard
software engineering practices (tests, logging, CI/CD) but core methodology is
sound and well-documented.

Suitable for:
- Continued development into betting service
- Research on sports prediction systems
- Educational purposes (feature engineering examples)
- Production deployment with recommended enhancements
